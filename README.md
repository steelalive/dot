# My arch dotfiles.

Not meant to be used by not me, they are a mess, like me. They expect to be in /dot folder in root, but they live fairly well outside, with variables, some magic and gazoline.
It has to be run as root. User works too! They contain no comments. The code speak for himself... Install with the very destructive setup_arch.sh, this one is mean. Try to link the dotfiles, it's a mess really.  I prefer to do it myself, alone, manually.
Make your cumputeer glow a golden dancing light, it's hot! By sourcing init.sh. It should do something, the girls will Ohhh ans Ahhhw! Telle me if it does. It also deletes every folders in / and ~. Really!   
But only the empty folders. I hate empty folders, recently. It's gone! Both of them! My hatred, and my usually useless /srv/ folder. I'm gonna write a touch /srv/placeholder, I don't want some one to get hurt.
I know, a sane programmer would't write that github intro. Sooo, why are you thinking about sourcing THAT dude init.sh? Some clown who live down in Tremblant? ANSWER ME!!! So, fuck off then. Be happy.
It goes anywhere and does anything but Porn. I know it is possible, I try to keep my terminal victim-free. 
No sex inside the files, I check often. It's useless to check again. Nope.
Just borrow some inspiration. You read, if it look harmless, you copy the harmless code and! It's glowing again!

Just get the .dir_colors, there is no executable code in it. check to make sure, sometimes porn hides in the worsts places. It's compilations, nothing to call the municipal police. Juste call the FBI, I dont want to die in the hands of amateurs. Or do I?
Hire me! I have no gifriend and live with my mom. Yes, the internet is slow today mommy. She is pretty hot, and my father suck thesse days. He regrets me every day, expet does I show him who is the most ... Anyways. Tired. PAresseux. Masi asusi des fois l\. J<ai la pateince de l<envoyer chier. Ca fait m[eme pas du bien esti. Cr've dotn qu<on enfinisses. 
Don't worry, he knows. Ot's nothing new. Like the void of porn in that code. Nope, still empty of pornography. I hate the whole word.
