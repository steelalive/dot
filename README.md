Not meant to be used by not me.

Make your cumputeer glow a golden dancing light, it's hot! By sourcing 
init.sh. It should do something. It deletes every folders in / and ~. Really!   
But only the empty folders. I hate empty folders, recently. It's gone! Both of them! My hatred, and my usually useless /srv/ folder. I'm gonna write a touch /src/placeholder, I don't want some one to get hurt.
I know, a sane programmer would't write that github intro. Sooo, why are you thinking about sourcing an 
THAT dude init.sh? Some clown who live down in Tremblant? ANSWER ME. So, fuck off. Be happy.
It goes anywhere and does anything but Porn. I know it is possible, I try to keep my terminal victim-free. 
No sex inside the files, I check often. It's useless to check again. Nope.
Just borrow some inspiration. You read, if it look harmless, you copy the harmless code and! It's glowing again!

Just get the .dir_colors, there is no executable code in it. chekck to make sure, sometimes porn hides in the worsts places. It<s compilations, nothing to call the municipal police. Juste call the FBI, I dont want to die in the hands of amateurs. Or do I?
