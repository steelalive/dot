# My arch dotfiles

Hi, what I think is the most interesting I created in this repo is a bash PS1 prompt. It show’s CPU temp, percentage of memory and CPU load with colors that vary from violet to red, following the color spectrum order. So, you can see the color red and know that ram is full or CPU load is 100%. Violet mean it’s at 0%. The hundreds values in between tries to follow a certain color order. \

What I consider neat is how my terminal stay’s snappy. A function runs in the background and write to a file every five seconds the values that the terminal . The normal ps1 display is independent, like PWD or username.  I write for myself, some code only activate under specific conditions, namely hostname. I would gladly make it more portable if anyone ask. Or feel free to make it more portable, I’d like to see your work if you do. \

All in all, this is the dotfile repo I wish I would have found when I started writing code. It’s not perfect in any way, it’s just good enough for me and always evolving. I hope to inspire you in you own projects. \
