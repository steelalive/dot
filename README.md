I wish I had the patience to comment code and code safely, but you know... priorities.
I started writing code on my commodore64, saving on a magnetphone like an old school pookie.
I hope to inspire a beginner like I used to be. Call me, if you wish to breach my contract
or you know, recognize a talent which your buisness would benifit Greatly. There is something
about me, it's been a while people try to avoid recognising it. You know, smalll northen town 
and all. To make an appointment:

Thanks you all for visiting and freely share! Send me your tits, girl! Boys, send your resumes.
