# My arch dotfiles

![GitHub Logo](/info/combine.png)
All in all, this is the dotfile repo I wish I would have found when I started writing code. It's OMG!
I chose that Dragon recently. It's never-ending chase. On my commodore64, I used to write \
Do-You-Want-To-Be-The-Hero prrimitive programs. The stories were linear, choose right or your life \
is now shit, and then you die. Like in real life. \
I hope my code inspire with people with this kinfof project. Someday, I wish I could be a computer \
technician of some sort. Tech-in-a-Dodge-Challenger. Your mother sister is just waiting to call me. \
She don't care why, until she will have recorded it on her laptop. Cellphone if she lost her laptop. \
