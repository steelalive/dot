# My arch dotfiles.

Not meant to be used by not me.
They expect to be in /dot folder in root.
And to be run as root.
They contain no comments.
Install with the very destructive setup_arch.sh
Make your cumputeer glow a golden dancing light, it's hot! By sourcing 
init.sh. It should do something. It delets every folders in / and ~. Only  
Only the empty folders. I hate empty folders. I hate them! I know, it's not sane.
So is sourcing an unknown init.sh of some clown who live in Tremblant. So fuck off.
It goes anywahere does anything but Porn. No sex inside the files, I check often. 
Or just borrow some inspiration. You read, if it<s smart or useful, you copy the 
harmless code and! It's glowing again!
