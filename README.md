# My arch dotfiles

![GitHub Logo](/info/combine.png)
All in all, this is the dotfile repo I wish I would have found when I started writing code. \
It’s just for me, you can expect the worst blindly running wild code. It’s just good enough for \
me. I chose that Dragon recently because it's never-ending chase. On my commodore64, I was writing \
Do-You-Want-To-Be-The-Hero . The story were linear, choose right or die in some gruesome way. Like \
in real life. \
I hope to inspire you in your own projects. Someday, I wish I could be a computer technician of some \
sort. Tech-in-a-Dodge-Challenger. Your mother sister is just waiting to call me. She don't care why \
until she will have done it. \
