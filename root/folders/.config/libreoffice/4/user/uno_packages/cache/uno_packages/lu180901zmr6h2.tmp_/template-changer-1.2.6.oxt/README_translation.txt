To help with translation of the TemplateChanger extension, you can do as follows:

- Open tc_l10n.ods and look for a table for your language
- if no such table exists, copy a existing table, rename it and type your language code in cell B1
- translate all missing strings in column D - Translated (lines with missing strings are marked yellow)
    do not translate names of variables ($file, $folder ...)
    "\n" will be converted to a newline
- review already translated strings
- send the entire document to me (andreschnabel@openoffice.org)

- to translate help, make a copy of the en-folder in help and name it according to your languga code .
- delete all but the *.xhp files
- translate text content of *.xhp (do not translate the XML tags or attributes)
- zip your help folder and send it to me (andreschnabel@openoffice.org)

- If you like you can translate the introduction of the license copyright info and add a link to a translated version of LGPL:
